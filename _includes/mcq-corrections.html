                <h1>Question 23</h1>

                    Assume that array arr has been defined and initialized with the values {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}. What are the values in array arr after two passes of the for loop (i.e., when j = 2 at the point indicated by / * end of for loop * / ) ?

                    Insertion sort works by taking an element and moving it until it is behind an element that is greater than it.<br>
                    By the end of the first iteration, the element with an index of 1 (4) is moved to index 0 -> {4, 5, 3, 2, 1}<br>
                    By the end of the second iteration, the element with an idex of 2 (3) is moved to the index of 0 -> {3, 4, 5, 2, 1}<br>
                    At this point, j = 2 at the spot indicated, therefore the answer is <color class="red red-hover">{3, 4, 5, 2, 1}</color>

                <h1>Question 26</h1>

                    <img src="https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/b95c26a3cc8f679129c850612502ca36/original.jpg"><br>
                    What is printed as a result of the call start() ?
                </p>
                <p class="box rounded-corners post-box">
                    Within the method <code>start()</code>, the method <code>changeIt()</code> is called. <code>changeIt()</code> is supposed to 
                    modify inputted variables, but it effectively does nothing since, when variables are passed into Java methods, copies are passed, 
                    not references to their location in memory. Thus, no change is made, and <color class="red red-hover">1 2 3 4 5 6 blackboard</color> is 
                    printed out, making that the correct answer.
                </p>

                    Which of the following represents board after this code segment is executed?
                </p>
                <p class="box rounded-corners post-box">
                    The nested for loop fills the entire array with O's.<br>
                    The next for loop starts at cells with odd numbered rows and columns of 0 and moves 1 cell to the top (<code>row--</code> moves up) 
                    and right (<code>col++</code> moves to the right), filling each of these cells with X's.<br>
                    So, the resulting array should have <color class="red red-hover">diagonal lines going up and to the right</color>; these 
                    lines should <color class="red red-hover">start at [1][0] and [3][0]</color>.<br>
                    The answer is thus:<br>

                <h1>Question 36</h1>
                <p class="box rounded-corners post-box">
                    <img src="https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/c491394df4b2ea611a55d9888a4fd4f3/original.jpg"><br>
                    Suppose the binarySearch method is called with an array containing 2,000 elements sorted in increasing order. What is the maximum number 
                    of times that the statement indicated by / * Calculate midpoint * / could execute?
                </p>
                <p class="box rounded-corners post-box">
                    The binary search algorithm repeatedly splits a given array in halves until the number it searches for is in the middle 
                    of one of the halves. At its slowest, the passed array will be split into halves until the array is at a length of 1. To 
                    find the maximum number of iterations, we would need to find how many times the array can be split until it cannot be 
                    split any further. Since the array is being halves, taking the log of the size of the array with a base of 2 would give 
                    us our answer.<br>
                    log<sub>2</sub>(2000) is approximately 11 (2<sup>11</sup> = 2048), so <color class="red">11</color> is our answer.

                    What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

                    1. "Alex", "Bob", and "Carl" are added to <code>students</code><br>
                    2. The <code>set()</code> method returns the current value at a given index, so "Alex Bob Carl" is printed out (with a 
                    line break) while all elements of the <code>ArrayList</code> are replaced with "Alex"<br>
                    3. All elements of the <code>ArrayList</code> are printed out -> "Alex Alex Alex" is printed out (with a line break)<br>
                    Therefore, the output is:<br>
                    <color class="red">Alex Bob Carl<br>Alex Alex Alex</color>
