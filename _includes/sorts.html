                <p class="box rounded-corners post-box">
                    Over the past week or so, I worked on implementing sorting algorithms on a data type of my own creation. 
                    In my case, this meant creating algorithms for <color class="red red-hover">selection</color>, 
                    <color class="red red-hover">bubble</color>, and <color class="red red-hover">merge</color> sorting algorithms, 
                    which I would run on a <color class="red red-hover">queue</color>, the class for which I made by myself. 
                    My hope is that my implementation will fulfull <color class="yellow yellow-hover">Objective #2</color>.

                <h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>
                <p class="box rounded-corners post-box">
                    As I attempted to pursue Objective #2, there were some requirements which I wish to waive.<br>
                    My implementation of bubble sort was fairly complex (as I explain <a class="blue blue-hover" href="#bubble">later on</a>), 
                    and as a result, the performance of my algorithm was negatively affected. This made it hard for Java to process 
                    5000 elements of data for bubble sort. I tried doing so, and I have depicted my results below.

                    The program was set to run selection, then bubble, then merge sort.<br>
                    As shown, selection sort finished in ~0.18 sec.<br>
                    After over 24 minutes, bubble sort still wasn't done.

                    This is all to say that <color class="red red-hover">5000 terms was not doable</color> with my implementation, 
                    especially given how I planned on running each algorithm twelve times. 
                    And thus, I opted for a more humble <color class="red red-hover">500 terms</color>, which I found can still reveal how 
                    not all sorting algorithms are made equal.<br>
                    Other than that, I believe I incorporated all required elements of the assignment.

                <p class="box rounded-corners post-box">
                    Each sorting algorithm is a subclass of the Sort superclass. From this superclass, each algorithm inherits a 
                    Queue for storing times, a method to add times to the <color class="red red-hover">Queue</color>, a 
                    <color class="red red-hover">method</color> to average all times (removing the lowest and highest times), and a 
                    <color class="red red-hover">method</color> to make sure the sorted Queue really is sorted. Along with those, the 
                    Sort class contains the <code class="yellow">generateData()</pre></code> method, which fills the 
                    <color color="red">static</color> data Queue with <a class="blue blue-hover" href="#limitations">500</a> random ints. 
                    I made the data variable static to ensure that it was constant across all of the subclass sorting algorithms.

                <h3 id="selection">Selection Sort</h3>
                <p class="box rounded-corners post-box">
                    Selection sort involves searching through a given data set, finding the term of least value 
                    (i.e. <color class="red red-hover">selecting</color> the smallest term), adding that value to a new data set, 
                    removing it from the original set, and repeating. Since Selection Sort frequently compares terms in a data set to 
                    a variable (the variable that contains the lowest int), Selection Sort features 
                    <color class="red red-hover">many comparisons</color>. However, terms are <color class="red red-hover">not swapped</color>.

                <p class="box rounded-corners post-box">
                    As one may expect, this algorithm does not scale very well. Until the set is fully sorted, the algorithm searches term-by-term 
                    through the entire set to find the lowest int.<br>
                    Since Selection Sort involves searching through the data set of length <color class="yellow yellow-hover">n</color> 
                    a total of <color class="yellow yellow-hover">n</color> times, this algorithm has a time complexity of

                <h3 id="merge">Merge Sort</h3>
                <p class="box rounded-corners post-box">
                    By contrast, the merge sort is a relatively efficient sorting algorithm. It involves splitting a given data set in halves 
                    until single-element sets are formed. Single-element sets of a common parent are compared with each other and sorted. 
                    These sets are then <color class="red red-hover">merged</color> back together to form a complete, sorted set. 
                    Since Merge Sort makes comparisons and swaps at the lowest level, this algorithm features 
                    <color class="yellow yellow-hover">few comparisons and swaps</color>.

                    Bubble Sort was by far the least efficient algorithm I tested, as illustrated by the issues I detailed

                    classes I made, and I ended up having to use both <color class="yellow yellow-hover">Queues</color> and

                        Since the top element of the stack is smaller than the element that precedes it, we switch the two. Then, we add the remaining elements, which were stored in the newData Queue.

                    Bubble Sort involves reading all terms of a given data set, and in addition to that, it is a 
                    <color class="red red-hover">recursive</color> algorithm. Thus, Bubble Sort has a time complexity of

                    Upon running the main tester method of the Sort class, twelve tests of each sorting algorithm will be executed and 
                    times are collected, following which the highest and lowest times of each sorting algorithm are removed, and 
                    times are averaged. Average times of one test run are shown below.

                    As shown, Merge Sort has the lowest time, and Bubble Sort by far has the highest time. <br><br>
                    As previously discussed, Merge Sort is the only algorithm with a time complexity of O(n), with the other 
                    two algorithms having a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). <br><br>
                    Furthermore, the Merge Sort algorithm features few comparisons and few swaps, while the other two algorithms frequently 
                    do one or both. <br><br>
                    It is thus safe to conclude that <color class="red red-hover">Merge Sort is the most efficient</color> of the 
                    algorithms tested, and <color class="red red-hover">Bubble Sort is the least</color>.
